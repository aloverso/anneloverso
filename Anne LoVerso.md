## This site is for us both
This site is a work-in-progress.  There will be incomplete pages.  It's intended to be a growing, living document of my work and experiences, and by that nature, will always have tendrils of new ideas in the form of unfinished pages that I want to expand.

By that nature, it's for both of us. For me, to document, expand, explore, reflect, and self-connect. For you, to visit, observe, connect, and expand. I write things. You let me know what you think.
