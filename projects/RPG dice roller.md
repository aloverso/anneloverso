The **[RPG Dice Roller](http://rpgdiceroller.com/)** app is a simple, no-frills dice rolling app with a clean, simple UI.

I wrote this to demo some full-stack TypeScript patterns and then my hand slipped and I bought a domain name. Seriously, this app is better than most dice rolling websites out there because it does nothing but roll a number of dice. No modifiers, nothing special. Just dice. 

It integrates with the [random.org](https://www.random.org/) API to ensure the best random numbers for all your RPG needs.
