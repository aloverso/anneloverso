There are a lot of problems people point to in this world.  Systematic inequality.  Climate change.  Capitalistic exploitation of people and natural resources.  People also point to problems in the education system.  Failing schools, failing teachers, failing students.  It’s easy to get bogged down in it, and depressed by it, and forget about all the people working to do good.  Looking at that, I think that if I had to sum up my design manifesto of education in two words it would be ** critical optimism**.

**Critical** because a critical lens takes in observations and questions assumptions about the way things are constructed in society by challenging preconceived notions.  **Optimism** because despite the need to challenge the status quo, optimism imagines a better future and actively works to create one.  But in creating one, you need to design intentionally so that it actually achieves the goals and makes meaningful changes.  So back to critical.  The two become a looping cycle of improvement.  As my Wellesley education class portrayed it, it’s a two-sided coin of rage and hope.

(Aside here.  After writing this whole reflection up to this point, I sat back and was like "this term sounds like it might be a thing."  So I googled it and turns out it was a thing.  I didn't know that.  So let me say that when I use this term, I’m not basing it on any external definitions or research.  Pure grounded theory, one might say, except it’s just grounded in my brain and nothing else.)

Last semester, I wrote my teaching philosophy and how I view myself as a teacher.  This is my manifesto of educational design, and the way in which I situate myself in the world as a designer.  There is overlap here – teachers are educational designers.  But I want to step back into the systems context and the critically optimistic framework of the way I want to approach educational design.  This is more than me and my teaching.  This is the world.

## Rage (Critical)
- Notice injustice.  (Observe and research.  Ask questions.  Listen.)
- Refuse to stand for injustice.  (Question who a design benefits and whether it reinforces existing social schemas of oppression.)
- Question contradiction.  (Engage with it to understand leverage points of change.)
- Take a stance.  (Politics is part of what we do; acknowledge it.)
- Challenge assumptions.  (We fall into them naturally.)


## Hope (Optimism)
- Focus on people.  (Envision a world in which the people control the systems, not institutions or corporations.)
- Engage with context.  (Acknowledge the position of insiders and privilege those voices over your own.)
- Teach, don’t do.  (Empower people to continue to design for their own self-improvement after the interaction has ended and provide the tools and skills necessary to do so.) 
- Assume the best.  (People want to do good; make good systems that help them.)

These should co-exist with intention, a designer switching seamlessly between the two frameworks as determined by the situation.  Educational design impacts lives and livelihoods, and people’s opportunity for opening opportunities.  It cannot be done carelessly, or worse, in a way of active harm to people.  Educational design is about justice.  The rage and hope cycle of critical optimism is a framework to fight for that justice in an active and proactive way.
