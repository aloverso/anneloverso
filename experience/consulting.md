To me, consulting is another form of [[teaching]].  The same principles apply - humility, empathy, co-learning and co-creating.

The consulting skills and style I've learned at [[VMware Pivotal Labs]] involve embedding within a client team and contributing to their growth and transformation.  The most important part of this is helping the team to grow itself, and not imposing changes upon it.  I've written about this topic in my [blog post on consulting as co-creation](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/consulting-as-a-co-creation-conversation).  The most important part of this is building trust and being a partner, not an authority.  I put a lot of value in my ability to connect with people, communicate effectively, and leverage their own unique skills and abilities to identify ways that they and their organization can be self-empowered to grow and change.
