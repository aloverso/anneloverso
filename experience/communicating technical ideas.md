I'm good at this.  Here's some quotes from coworkers & stakeholders:

> In discussions about feasibility, I really appreciate the way you describe tech feasibility. You don’t try to dumb down the issues at hand, you bring the listeners into the issues, and demonstrate “here’s what the database looks like” through diagrams and other communication tools.  You help people understand the tech stack and what it means to consider a certain concept, and you get at some core assumptions people might have about tech and helping adjust them.

> I like your visuals, especially for remote meetings, the flows visually help follow the flow of conversation. You go into the right level of detail for the audience, and it’s clear about the tradeoffs.

> Your diagrams go a long way in explaining things.

## Value
Engineers don't work in a vacuum.  As someone trained as an engineer with a strong design and product background, I recognize that technical work is not valuable if it can't be talked about and discussed by non-technical folks.  Good engineering comes from [[cross-functional]] conversations.  And for those conversations to happen, it's necessary to be able to communicate about technical concepts in a clear, approachable, and understandable way.  This allows us to have all voices participate in the process of building a product.
